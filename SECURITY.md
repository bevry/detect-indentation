## Supported Versions

This project uses [Bevry's automated tooling](https://github.com/bevry/boundation) to deliver the latest updates, fixes, and improvements inside the latest release while still maintaining widespread ecosystem compatibility.

No need to wait for a scheduled release, our CI [auto-merges](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/automating-dependabot-with-github-actions) [Dependabot security updates](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates) and also [auto-publishes](https://github.com/bevry-actions/npm) each successful build of the [`master` branch](https://github.com/bevry/wait/actions?query=branch%3Amaster) to the [`next` version tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/detect-indentation?activeTab=versions).
